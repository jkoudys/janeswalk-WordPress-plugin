the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
